## **Guzo Ave — Closet Sale Website 

### **Goal**

I want a simple and personal website where I can sell clothes from my own closet.
The goal is for it to feel warm, honest, and clean — not like a store, but like someone visiting my closet.

---

### **Overall Look**

* The design should be very **minimal and elegant**.
* **Colors:** white background, light beige or soft neutral accents, black text.
* **Font:** something simple and modern (like Montserrat or Lato).
* No bright colors — I want everything to look calm and clean.
* It should look good on both phones and laptops.

---

### **Navigation**

At the top of every page, there should be a small bar with:

* My logo in text: **GUZO AVE** (centered and in capital letters).
* Three links: **Home | Shop | Contact**
* Keep it visible when scrolling.

---

### **Home Page**

This should be the first thing people see.

1. **Main photo:** a picture of me (you can crop it however looks best).

   * Over the picture, write a welcome message that feels personal.
     Example (but make it look nice on the screen):

   > *Hello! Welcome to my closet sale. I’m passionate about fashion, and these are pieces I’ve loved but want to pass on. I hope you’ll give them a new life and love them as much as I did. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!*

2. **Shop Button:**

   * Below the text, add a simple black button that says **SHOP NOW**.
   * When people click it, it should take them to the Shop page.

3. **Category Preview:**

   * Below that, show a small preview of the sections I have.
   * Each one should have a photo (like a jacket photo for “Jackets”) with the name written over it.
   * Categories:

     * Exercise Clothing
     * Jackets
     * Shoes
     * Pants
     * Tops
   * When people click a category, it should scroll or go straight to that section on the Shop page.

---

### **Shop Page**

This is the main page where people will see everything I’m selling.
Each category will have its own section with a title and a row of pictures you can scroll through horizontally.

* **Category titles:** Big and clear — “Exercise Clothing,” “Jackets,” etc.
* **Each item:**

  * Big photo
  * Under it: item name, size, and price
  * On hover (or tap on phone), show a small button that says **I’m Interested**

When someone clicks **I’m Interested**, I want a small pop-up or message to appear that says:

> “Please reach out to me with the item name to complete your purchase! Payment is through Zelle or Venmo.”

Then show:

* My **email address**
* My **phone number** (so they can text me)

---

### **Contact Page**

A very simple page.
Title: **Contact Me**

Below it, text like this:

> “If you’re interested in something, message me with the name of the item and I’ll make sure it gets delivered to you. Payments are made through Zelle or Venmo.”

Then add:

* My email (clickable so it opens their mail)
* My phone number (clickable so it opens text or WhatsApp on mobile)
* Optional: small Instagram link at the bottom

---

### **Other Notes**

* Make sure everything looks clean and organized.
* All photos should be the same size (square looks best).
* The site should scroll smoothly and feel calm.
* Somewhere small (like the footer), always add:

  > “Payments accepted via Zelle or Venmo 💸”
