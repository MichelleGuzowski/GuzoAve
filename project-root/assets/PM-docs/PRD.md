PRD (Product Requirements Document)
Project title: Guzo Ave
One-sentence goal of the website: I want to display my new fashion brand called Guzo Ave. The website will showcase all available products modeled on people so customers can clearly see what they are buying.
3–5 core features (written as bullet points or user stories):
•	I want users to be able to click on each product image to view size options, colors, availability, and a short description of each clothing item.
•	I want users to be able to add items to their cart and later complete their purchase through an easy checkout process.
•	I want users to browse clothing through different sections such as dresses, pants, or special edits like fall, cotton, or bridal.
•	I want the website to be responsive so that it works smoothly on phones, tablets, and computers.
•	I want the shopping experience to be simple and clean, similar to luxury fashion websites.
List of 4–6 intended pages (e.g., homepage, about, gallery, contact):
1.	Main page where users can access different sections of the website such as the new collection or the fall edit.
2.	Shop section where users can explore any category such as jeans, dresses, or tops.
3.	Sale section that highlights discounted or limited-time items.
4.	Explore section that includes a lookbook with styled outfits and campaign photos.
5.	Checkout section where customers can review their cart, apply promo codes, and pay securely.
brief notes on design/interaction:
The website will have a minimal and modern design inspired by brands like WeWoreWhat. The color palette will include neutral tones such as white, beige, and black. The focus will be on large, high-quality photos that show the clothing clearly. Fonts will mix serif and sans-serif styles to create a clean but elegant look. The navigation bar will remain visible as users scroll, and hovering over a product image will show another angle of the same clothing item. Smooth transitions and simple animations will make the website feel professional and easy to use. Future updates could include features such as a wishlist, newsletter sign-up, or a dark mode option.
