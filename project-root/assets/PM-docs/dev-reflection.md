# Dev Reflection

**How I interpreted and implemented someone else’s idea:**  
I created a fashion website for Michelle. I took her vision and designs and translated them into a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean, modern, and editorial aesthetic.

**Challenges in development and collaboration:**  
The main challenges were handling interactive elements like slideshows, modals, and forms while maintaining the intended design. Communicating effectively with Michelle helped address ambiguities and refine the implementation.

**Parts where I used AI tools and what I learned:**  
I used AI to help debug code, suggest clean implementations, and clarify JavaScript interactions. AI helped speed up development and improve the structure of my code, while ensuring the functionality matched the original design.

**Reflection:**  
This project taught me how important it is to carefully interpret someone else’s vision and translate it into code. Collaboration, iterative feedback, and AI-assisted debugging were key to successfully building the site.
