# PM Reflection

**How I came up with my idea:**  
I helped design a cooking recipe webpage. The idea was to create a simple, clean interface where users could browse and explore recipes easily, with clear navigation and visually appealing layout.

**How well the collaboration with the developer worked:**  
Collaboration was smooth. I provided wireframes, visual guidelines, and notes on functionality, and the developer implemented them efficiently. Regular communication helped ensure the final webpage matched the vision.

**What I learned about writing requirements:**  
I learned that writing detailed and precise requirements is crucial. Including examples and desired behaviors helps developers understand exactly what is expected and reduces back-and-forth.

**Did you use any AI tools in this process? How?:**  
Yes, I used AI to refine the design ideas, structure requirements, and clarify any ambiguous parts of the project. This helped make the planning phase more efficient.

**Reflection:**  
Working as a PM on this project reinforced the importance of clear communication, detailed planning, and iterative feedback. Well-written requirements make the development process smoother and more predictable.
