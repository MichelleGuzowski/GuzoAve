I came up with this idea because I have always wanted to have a closet sale of my own and never knew what was the best aproach for it, I wasnt sure if posting on social media, creating my own website or just sending pictures of my clothing on a group chat, this is where i thought this project was the perfect idea since I could visualize how the website would look like and if it is something I could actuallt do. I believe me and my collaborator gretel worked very well together since she really understood exactly what I wanted for my website and we had very good communication. I learned that writing requierments need to be super specific so that the PM and the colaborator understand each other very well because if not they will not know what to do. I used AI in the process with help writing the description since I wanted it to be as specific as possible and thought that was the best way.
